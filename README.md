## 🧠 Authentication & Cart Logic

### Guest Flow:
1. User visits website
2. Items added to guest session cart
3. Cart stored temporarily

### Login Flow:
1. User logs in
2. Guest cart items are merged into user's database cart
3. Duplicate products are handled properly (quantities updated)

### Logout Flow:
1. User logs out
2. Current cart items are stored in guest session
3. Cart restored on next login

This ensures a seamless shopping experience without losing user data.
